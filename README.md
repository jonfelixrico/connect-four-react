# Tic Tac Toe

This is my project for learning React Typescript. I have a few goals for this project. Each task will have a list that highlights the new things that I try to learn or add in the project.

- [ ] Create the main app
  - Setting up React (via CRA + Craco)
  - React fundamentals (hooks!)
  - Tailwind
  - Unit testing via Jest
- [ ] Integrate a componeny library
  - Maybe Material UI? Semantic UI? Ant?
- [ ] Animations!
- [ ] Tic tac toe AI via Minmax with AB pruning
- [ ] Multiplayer
  - Nest.js with SocketIO

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
